description: Here is what I read in 2020
---

Continuing my theme of selective reading as I did in 2019 I read fewer
books but tried to only read books that really interested me.

Overall I read 5705 pages from 17 books.

**There are no spoilers on this page.**

How I rate my books:

- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Loved it and would read again
- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Liked it but wouldn’t read again
- ⭐️⭐️⭐️  Meh but finished
- ⭐️⭐️  Didn't enjoy it but finished
- ⭐️  Didn't enjoy it and stopped reading

These books are not presented in any specific order.

### Accelerate - Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble and Gene Kim

![](images/accelerate.jpg)

**288 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was a good book. I wouldn't say that I would read it again, but
it is certainly interesting to investigate as a technology company. It
feels good when an organization is already reaching those goals.

Bottom line: The authors have done a ton of research to figure out
what helps companies accelerate. Acceleration can help your company
win the market or even just stay afloat. As the times change we need
every advantage we could get. Find the capabilities online and assess
yourself.

### An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management - Jez Humble

![](images/an-elegant-puzzle.jpg)

**288 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I will definitely refer back to this book. He outlines his experiences and learnings from his experience. I took away that I need to learn about Systems Thinking and read a book called Good Strategy / Bad Strategy.

I would spend more time re-reading chapter 3.

I will likely refer back to this book when issues arise.

- Make a succession plan
- Size teams rightly
- Hire right

### Hiking Through - Paul Stutzman

**336 pages** · ⭐️⭐️

I thought this book was meh at best. Every paragraph followed the same formula.

I crossed a peak, did 25 miles, saw someone and slept. Book has heavy
doses of faith in the book.

### Hillbilly Elegy - J.D. Vance

![](images/hillbilly-elegy.jpg)

**291 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

This book was a stark reminder of how things are in different parts of
the country. The biggest takeaway is that having an advocate in your
life can help you in ways that others could not.

### Letters From an Astrophysicist - Neil deGrasse Tyson

![](images/letters-from-an-astrophysicist.jpg)

**272 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Tyson has thoughtful responses to tough questions in life pertaining
to the universe.

Bottom line: The purpose of science is not to make people feel
good. Too many people start out with an answer in mind and try to
steer people towards it. Science is about acknowledging that we do not
know the answer and we want to discover it.


### Naked Statistics - Charles Wheelan

![](images/naked-statistics.jpg)

**304 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I liked this book because it gave me insights to how standard statistics are used and how they are abused. It uses everyday examples which is more helpful than being given a few pages of formulas.

Topics I found particularly useful

- Normal distribution and errors
- Median vs mean, think of the example with Bill Gates walking into a bar and raising the income average. Or Bush's tax cuts (to the ultra rich)
- Correlation and how it doesn't matter the units of what we're measuring
- Probability with the expected value
- Monty Hall problem
- Central limit theorem - The mean of a sample falls within a normal distribution of the real mean of the whole population. This tells us that given a sample we can calculate with a certain probability how likely it is that our sample is both representative or possibly not representative of the whole population
- Inference, polling, and regression.
    - How likely is it that this thing happened, does the probability say it is an unlikely event to be categorized as another group?
    - How representative of the actual results are my polling results
    - How much does my dependent variables describe my situation


### Old Man's War - John Scalzi

![](images/old-mans-war.jpg)

**320 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Quick and entertaining read. I don't think I'll invest in the series, though.

### Perennial seller - Ryan Holiday

![](images/perennial-seller.jpg)

**256 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I would reread this book for sure.

### Skyward - Brandon Sanderson

![](images/skyward.jpg)

**544 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I thought this was an amazing book. I did the audio book and the
acting was top notch!

### Starsight - Brandon Sanderson

![](images/starsight.jpg)

**461 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I also thought this was an amazing book. I read the physical book and
I'm dying to know what happens next.

### The Inevitable - Kevin Kelly

![](images/the-inevitable.jpg)

**336 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Essentially we are not racing technology but we are running with
it. It creates new opportunities that didn’t even exist yesterday. We
have no idea what will be available to us in the future.


### The Making of a Manager: What to do when Everyone Looks to You - Julie Zhuo

![](images/the-making-of-a-manager.jpg)

**288 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This was an okay book. It was very design-centric but there are better books out there on becoming an Engineering manager.
Becoming an Effective Software Engineering Manager comes to min.

### The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemmingway

![](images/the-old-man-and-the-sea.jpg)

**74 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

I read this book based on a recommendation. I can't say that I loved the book that much.

### The Wealthy Gardener - John Soforic

![](images/the-wealthy-gardener.jpg)

**431 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I thought there were a lot of pearls of wisdom in this book. It really
got me thinking about a bunch of financial stuffs. There were parts
which were a little reminiscent of "The Secret." I believe that the
secret just prepares you to make you ready for what comes next. I need
to buy the physical book so that I can follow up on some of the
lessons.


### Walkable City: How downtown can save America - Jeff Speck

![](images/walkable-city.jpg)

**320 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

There were some interesting ideas in this book but I wouldn't say that
I would recommend it to people. There were times when it felt like the
author had a pure vendetta against people in the planning
community. As a member of a community there wasn't much actionable
advice here. I do feel like I have a better idea of what makes a city
walkable, though.

### Warbreaker - Brandon Sanderson

![](images/warbreaker.jpg)

**592 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Solid book. Standalone and not part of a series. Not the best
Sanderson book I've read, but it is better than most fantasy books by
miles. I like that Hoyd was part of the book telling stories.

### Wherever You Go There You Are - Jon Kabat-Zinn

![](images/wherever-you-go-there-you-are.jpg)

**304 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

I don't know if this book hit me at the right time or not. I gave it a
solid 3 stars. I think the book was way too long. Perhaps I felt this
way because there wasn't much new for me in this book. If this is the
first book on mindfulness it would probably shine brighter.
