description: Here is what I read in 2019
---

In 2019 I read a lot of books but I changed my goals a bit. In 2018 I
set a hard reading goal which resulted in reading 25 books. However, I
realized that I set a goal for the sake of having a goal. This creates
pressure but I didn't need the pressure to read.

Overall I completed 7327 pages from 22 books which results in a 34%
decrease from last year.

**There are no spoilers on this page.**

How I rate my books:

- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Loved it and would read again
- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Liked it but wouldn’t read again
- ⭐️⭐️⭐️  Meh but finished
- ⭐️⭐️  Didn't enjoy it but finished
- ⭐️  Didn't enjoy it and stopped reading

These books are not presented in any specific order.

### Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker, PhD

![](images/why-we-sleep.jpg)

**368 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Before reading this book I knew the importance of sleep. I understood
that getting a good night sleep is critical for memory and
health. After reading this book I learned that our lives depend on
having sleep and enough sleep opportunity.

After the second or third chapter you are presented with a clear idea
on why sleep is important. The book is filled with enough evidence
that we are instructed to take it serious.

### Forest Bathing – Dr. Qing Li

**320 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

I loved being outside before reading this book. I felt that it was
targeted to people that already didn't spend enough time outdoors. The
book is full of colorful scenery. I felt that it lacked references to
scientific studies.

Takeaway: Spend time in nature. It is an easy and enjoyable thing to
do. If the benefits are great for you then it is even better.

### The call of the wild - Jack London

![](images/call-of-the-wild.jpg)

**64 pages** · ⭐️

I started this book because I've heard that Jack London is a great
writer. No doubt in my mind that he is, but I couldn't sustain
interest in this book.

### Measure what matters – John Doerr

![](images/measure-what-matters.jpg)

**320 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

This would have been better as a blog post. The contents of the book
are trendy in software companies right now. I feel that OKRs are a
sensible practice that is successful because it is simpler and
different from whatever process a company currently uses.

### Ultra learning – Scott Young

![](images/ultra-learning.jpg)

**305 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I always enjoy books about learning. At times the book felt anecdotal
and derived from the experiences of a handful of people. However, I
believe there are gems of wisdom in this book. Take the practices
presented and apply them to your life.

### Children of Time – Adrian Tchaikovsky

![](images/children-of-time.jpg)

**640 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I don't normally read a lot of science fiction. I read this book to
branch out of my regular reading trends and I'm glad I did.

### The First 90 Days –  Michael Watkins

![](images/the-first-90-days.jpg)

**304 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

My quick summary is to figure out what kind of position you are in and
come up with a 90 day plan to make changes.

### The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand

![](images/the-fountainhead.jpg)

**720 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I really liked this book. It has been recommended to me many
times. I'm glad I took the time to finally read it.

### The obstacle is the way - Ryan Holiday

![](images/the-obstacle-is-the-way.jpg)

**224 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

If you like ideas presented by Stoic philosophers then this is the
book for you.

### Getting Clojure – Russ Olsen

![](images/getting-clojure.jpg)

**290 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Read this book if you are new to Lisp or Clojure.

### Perennial Seller - Ryan Holiday

![](images/perennial-seller.jpg)

**256 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

### Steelheart – Brandon Sanderson

![](images/steelheart.jpg)

Brandon Sanderson writes so many good books. I think this falls into
the YA genre and I didn't mind.

**432 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐

### Ego is the Enemy - Ryan Holiday

![](images/ego-is-the-enemy.jpg)

**256 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐

Also a book with Stoic ideas.

### Norse Mythology – Neil Gaiman

![](images/norse-mythology.jpg)

**304 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I didn't know much about Norse mythology. I enjoyed Neil Gaiman's
treatment of the subject.

### The things you can see only when you slow down – Haemin Sunim

![](images/the-things-you-can-see.jpg)

**288 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

Take a breath, slow down, and look around.

### Atomic habits - James Clear

![](images/atomic-habits.jpg)

**320 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I've read many books on habit making and breaking. I think this book
is one of the best.

### All these wonders - The Moth

![](images/all-these-wonders.jpg)

**352 pages** · ⭐️⭐⭐️⭐

I read this book because I value the insights and experience of
others. This is an enlightening book. People write about their lives in
a real, honest, cutting way.

### The Daily Stoic

![](images/the-daily-stoic.jpg)

**416 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐

Get your daily dose of Stoicism.

### And then there were none - Agatha Christie

![](images/and-then-there-were-none.jpg)

**300 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐⭐

I don't usually read mystery books. I liked this.

### The Making of a Manager: What to do when Everyone Looks to You - Julie Zhuo

![](images/the-making-of-a-manager.jpg)

**288 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐⭐

There are some pearls of advice in this book. Very quick read. There
is no way to really know where you are on your management journey but
chances are that Julie Zhuo has been there. I'm enjoying An Elegant
Puzzle right now because it is more applicable to Engineering
Management.

### The Dispatcher - John Scalzi

![](images/the-dispatcher.jpg)

**128 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐⭐

I read this short story to sample John Scalzi's writing. I liked his
style.

### The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August - Claire North

![](images/the-first-fifteen-lives.jpg)

**432 pages** · ⭐️⭐️⭐⭐

I heard good things about this book. It was new and fresh. Anyone
interested in interesting time mechanics should read this book.
